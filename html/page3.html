<p>
    As soon as you enter in the code, an alarm begins going off.<br><br>
    You have no choice but to turn around and run.<br><br>
    You make it away without getting caught but surely the agency will be on high alert now.<br><br>
    There's no way for you to get in.<br><br>
    MISSION FAILED
