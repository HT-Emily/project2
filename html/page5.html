<p>
    You go left while carefully listening for any sounds of security.<br><br>
    You hear footsteps coming from further down the hall.<br><br>
    You try to duck down a hallway to the left but you hear footsteps coming from that way as well.<br><br>
    You turn to the right but there are footsteps coming from that way too.<br><br>
    You look back towards the way you come from but see a security guard that spots you.<br><br>
    Guards from each direction begin running towards you and you are trapped.<br><br>
    MISSION FAILED
