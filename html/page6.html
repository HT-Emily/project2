<p>
    You go right while carefully listening for any sounds of security.<br><br>
    You hear none as you make your way through but remain cautious.<br><br>
    You're on the lookout for any paths that may lead you back towards the office but the path just keeps leading you deeper into the agency's headquarters.<br><br>
    You get a bit confused on where you are in the building and begin guessing on directions to go in.<br><br>
    Finally, you reach a dead end. Unsure of what to do, you turn around and start heading back.<br><br>
    You go to take a left turn and run directly into a security guard.<br><br>
    MISSION FAILED
