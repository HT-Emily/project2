<p>
    You go forward while carefully listening for any sounds of security.<br><br>
    You hear footsteps coming from further down the hall to the right, but you have enough time to duck down a hallway to your left.<br><br>
    By continuing to take left turns you find yourself by the office with the computer you need to access.<br><br>
    You approach the computer, but before you can get the file you need, you'll have to figure out the login.<br><br>
    On the desk there is a framed photo of an adorable puppy. The puppy's dog tag says "Lil' Porkchop". There's also a calendar with a reminder saying "Anniversary with Meredith"<br><br>
    With very little to go off of, let's assume the username is the name of someone important to the agency's leader.
