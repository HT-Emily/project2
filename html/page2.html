<p>
    Congratulations! The door has unlocked, you're in.<br><br>
    There are three directions you can go in: left, right, or forward.<br><br>
    To your left would be the most direct route to go in but our thermal equipment detects at least 5 guards in that general direction. <br><br>
    If you go forward, our thermal equipment suggests there is only one guard that is patrolling the area.<br><br>
    To the right, there appears to be no security.<br><br>
    Which way do you go?
</p>
