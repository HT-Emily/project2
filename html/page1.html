    Hello Agent.<br><br>Your mission is to break into an enemy agency's headquarters,
    make your way to their leader's office, and download an important file onto a flashdrive and bring that back to us without getting caught.
    <br><br>We have located a side door with limited security that we believe to be your best chance in. However, there is a 4 digit code.
    The keypad has digits 1-9 and the numbers 1, 2, 6, and 9 appear to be worn out significantly more so than the others.
    <br><br>What number do you enter into the keypad?
</p>
